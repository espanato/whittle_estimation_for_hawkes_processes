# Whittle Estimation for Hawkes Processes

This repository contains three files:
- A Jupyter notebook for the implementation of the Whittle estimation in Python with some time execution graphs
- The R code used to compute the execution times  
- The C++ implementation of the Whittle estimation

## Dependencies

For the C++ implementation you will need the following dependencies:
- [Armadillo 11.1.1](http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html)
- [Alglib 3.18.0](https://www.alglib.net/download.php)

For the R code you will need to install the "hawkesbow" package via the following command in an R terminal:
install.packages("hawkesbow")
